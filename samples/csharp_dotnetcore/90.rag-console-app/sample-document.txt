Azure Blob Storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured object data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or to store application data privately.

Azure AI Search (formerly known as Azure Cognitive Search) is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for building a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.

Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Embeddings model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation.

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources. This approach allows for more accurate and contextually relevant responses by grounding the model's output in factual information retrieved from a knowledge base.

In a typical RAG implementation, documents are first processed and stored in a searchable format. When a user asks a question, relevant documents or passages are retrieved from the knowledge base, and then provided as context to the language model to generate a well-informed response.

This pattern is particularly useful for enterprise applications where you want to leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models while ensuring that the responses are based on your organization's specific data and knowledge.
