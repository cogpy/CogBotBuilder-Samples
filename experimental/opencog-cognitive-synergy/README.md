# OpenCog Cognitive Synergy Architecture

## Overview

This experimental implementation provides an OpenCog-based autonomous orchestrator for BotBuilder samples, enabling autogenesis of cognitive synergy architecture. The system combines:

1. **OpenCog AtomSpace**: Knowledge representation and reasoning
2. **Cognitive Synergy Engine**: Multi-agent coordination and emergent intelligence  
3. **Autonomous Orchestration**: Self-modifying and adaptive bot coordination
4. **Autogenesis Framework**: Self-organizing cognitive architectures

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Bots make independent decisions using OpenCog reasoning
- **Cognitive Synergy**: Multiple bots collaborate to achieve emergent intelligence
- **Self-Modification**: System can modify its own structure and behavior
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous improvement through experience
- **Dynamic Orchestration**: Runtime coordination of multiple cognitive agents

## Usage

See individual sample directories for specific examples of implementing cognitive synergy architecture with BotBuilder.
